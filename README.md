NMF (Non-negative matrix factorization) using WTA (winner-take-all) hashing. This hashing scheme have been successfully implemented in computer vision applications due to its discriminative nature utilizing rank correlation measures. We apply WTA hashing on NMF to compress the overall complexity. For a given mixture comprised of a number of active topics, the typical NMF operation can extract the given topics along with their activations. We show that the same task can be done in a compressed fashion with WTA hashing.  Our experiments show that WTA-hased NMF can discriminate latent topics as closely as in the original real-valued feature space.
